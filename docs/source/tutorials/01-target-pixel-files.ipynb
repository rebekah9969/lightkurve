    "Target Pixel Files (TPFs) are a file common to Kepler/K2 and the TESS mission. They contain movies of the pixel data centered on a single target star.\n",
    "\n",
    "TPFs can be thought of as stacks of images, with one image for every timestamp the telescope took data. Each timestamp is referred to as a **cadence**. These images are cut out 'postage stamps' of the full observation to make them easier to work with. \n",

    "TPFs are given in FITS files, which you can read more about [here](https://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/fits_primer.html). *Lightkurve* includes tools for you to work directly with these files easily and intuitively.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we'll cover the basics of working with TPFs. In *Lightkurve* there are classes to work with each mission. For example [`KeplerTargetPixelFile`](https://docs.lightkurve.org/api/lightkurve.targetpixelfile.KeplerTargetPixelFile.html#lightkurve.targetpixelfile.KeplerTargetPixelFile) deals with data from the Kepler (and K2) mission. [`TessTargetPixelFile`](https://docs.lightkurve.org/api/lightkurve.lightcurvefile.TessLightCurveFile.html#lightkurve.lightcurvefile.TessLightCurveFile) deals with data from the TESS mission. We'll use a Kepler TPF as an example.\n",
